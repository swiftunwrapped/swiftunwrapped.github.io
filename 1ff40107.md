- Swift Archival & Serialization: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md
- ABI Stability Dashboard: https://swift.org/abi-stability/

# SE-0167: Swift Encoders

- https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md
- Semantics of Codable Types in Archives
- NSValueTransformer
    - https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsvaluetransformer
    - http://nshipster.com/nsvaluetransformer/
- "In the future, we may add API to allow Swift types to provide an Objective-C class to decode as, effectively allowing for user bridging across archival."
- Similar to Russ Bishopâ€™s proposal
    - Allow Swift types to provide custom Objective-C representations
