There are tons of podcasts out there about general Apple/iOS/macOS development but nothing specifically about only the Swift programming language. 

So, we decided to make a podcast about the Swift language and a commentary on the [Swift Weekly Brief][1]. This podcast is a continuation on more details about Swift Weekly and our own thoughts on Swift news. 

If you want to connect with us you can find us and reach out on twitter: [JP Simard][2] & [Jesse Squires][3]

Be sure to subscribe so you don't miss episode 01 -  airing on Monday, March 6th and be sure to check out some of the other development shows that are a part of the [Spec Network][4].
